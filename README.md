# Breakthrough game in python.
The objective of the project is to implement the game Breakthrough in Python 3. It's a two-player game played on a chessboard where each player controls two rows of pawns that always move forward (either straight or diagonally) and capture diagonally. The goal is to be the first player to get a pawn to the other end of the board.

The game Breakthrough was invented by Dan Troyka in 2000. The game is usually played on a 7 × 7 or 8 × 8 chessboard but can be played on a chessboard of any size. For this project, we will use a 7 × 7 chessboard. At the beginning, each player has two full rows of pawns.
